# **Project Proposal**

Team Members:  **Osaru Elaiho**  •  **Daniel Jonas**  •  **Hayley Simmons**


## **Problem Statement**

Despite being taught that studying leads to academic success, students are instead spoon-fed information that reflects on our tests & quizzes. Consequently, many students adopt the habit of learning the material without dedicating any outside hours, with the goal of just getting by.

In short, ***students don't know how to learn/study.***

According to an article from *[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/04/15/many-students-dont-know-how-study-heres-how-parents-can-help/)*:

*"Researchers and experienced educators have found that often **students don’t have good study habits and skills**, or that **they rely on strategies that don’t work...**"*

*[Education World](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/04/15/many-students-dont-know-how-study-heres-how-parents-can-help/)* adds on to this statement:

*"…some approaches that teachers and parents recommend for studying such as **re-reading**, **highlighting** or **summarizing material**, might **not actually be effective**, especially over time."*


## **User Roles**
##### The "Student" 
  * *a user who doesn't know how to study and/or lack efficient study skills, but wants to improve their learning methods*
##### The "Instructor"
  * *a user who wishes to supplement their students with additional learning material outside the classroom*

## **User Personas**
##### Our "Students":
  * ***Steve*** is a high school junior who lives in a small town north of Dallas, Texas. Since Steve was a kid, he has had great aspirations of attending an Ivy league school & studying Computer Science. However, his dreams largely depend on his performance on his upcoming SAT. Despite his lacking in preparation, Steve is determined to succeed & prepare himself for the future.
  * ***Bailey*** is a rising junior at the University of Texas, majoring in Biology. She hopes to take her MCAT this upcoming fall. Though Bailey has always had trouble focusing on her work due to her ADHD, she recently sought out a psychiatrist who officially diagonosed her; Bailey is forturnately now on medication in order to help her focus. As her MCAT approches, she's ready to take advantage of her newfound attentiveness & study well.
##### Our "Instructors":
  * ***Francine*** is a new middle school teacher in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Recent studies showed that [New Mexico ranks last in the U.S. in K-12 education](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education/prek-12). Francine is quite familiar with technology, & is also aware of the positive effects it can have on young minds as they're developing. She aims to introduce her students to better methods of studying.
  * ***Stan*** has been an elementary teacher for over 25 years in Jersey City, New Jersey. He has been praised for his innovative teaching style & approach to students who struggle with different concepts. Stan is not that tech savvy, often opting for a more hands-on approach to the reinforcement of topics. However, after attending a teaching conference, he has had a change of heart & wants to employ the use of beginner-friendly technology that will ensure a smooth transition into online learning.
